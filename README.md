# School app

App meant to work like Moodle and Estudj.

The 2nd programmer had a map that he called Origami for some reason, I'm not sure how it worked. 

The files are also a mix of our programming styles (which we had opposite thoughts of) so It may be tough to read. I did all the CSS design by myself, I also did the profile and classes and their associated files. The same as previously every root .php file has it .inc.php file that does all of the functionality. We were also trying a style of structuring where all the functions would be in one file that would be included to ease some things but that ended up just being a very inflated file that holds all of the functionality that keeps the other .inc.php files shorter. 

If I could go back I would probably actually just include functions that overlap in that file not all of them.
